<p> I have used this page to demonstrate what I have learned so far in my Web Standards page. I have realized I'm basically learning a langauge. The 
    problem is that a small error here will just mess up eveyrthing, that's the biggest challenege I have faced so far. Other than that I had some trouble
    inserting a link but I came around finally. However, I have one question. On my code, on the title I have written "Lab 02: HTML Basics", but when I run 
    it, it shows "Lab 02" only. What have I missed?
</p>

<h3>What I have learned</h3>

<ul>
<li>How to use Visual Studio</li>
<li>How to use Github</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I look forward to learn</h3>

<ol>
<li>Get more familiar with html </li>
<li>How to add background images for my website</li>
<li>How to change font size and colors</li>
</ol>


<h2>Lab 3</h2>

<p>
    I have updated this page to demonstrate what I have learned on the third week of my Web Standards class. This was intitally my second lab file which I 
    have used some css styles to add basic CSS properties. I have learned that CSS is another language used aside HTML which is used to manage how elements 
    are displayd. I have used youtube quite much for this lab. I have also used the w3schools website as well. It was really helpful. I was confused as to why a css 
    file had to be opened however, everything was written on this html life. I only found out how to embed the CSS into the HTML file. On the last lab, I had some
    trouble submitting files into github and running it but this time it has gotten easier. Nevertheless, I will have to practice more on editing fonts, colors, background 
    images, and different styles to get familiar to it.
