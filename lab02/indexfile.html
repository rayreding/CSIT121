<p> I have used this page to demonstrate what I have learned so far in my Web Standards page. I have realized I'm basically learning a langauge. The 
    problem is that a small error here will just mess up eveyrthing, that's the biggest challenege I have faced so far. Other than that I had some trouble
    inserting a link but I came around finally. However, I have one question. On my code, on the title I have written "Lab 02: HTML Basics", but when I run 
    it, it shows "Lab 02" only. What have I missed?
</p>

<h3>What I have learned</h3>

<ul>
<li>How to use Visual Studio</li>
<li>How to use Github</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I look forward to learn</h3>

<ol>
<li>Get more familiar with html </li>
<li>How to add background images for my website</li>
<li>How to change font size and colors</li>
</ol>
