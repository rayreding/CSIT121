<p> I have used this page to demonstrate what I have learned so far in my Web Standards page. I have realized I'm basically learning a langauge. The 
    problem is that a small error here will just mess up eveyrthing, that's the biggest challenege I have faced so far. Other than that I had some trouble
    inserting a link but I came around finally. However, I have one question. On my code, on the title I have written "Lab 02: HTML Basics", but when I run 
    it, it shows "Lab 02" only. What have I missed?
</p>

<h3>What I have learned</h3>

<ul>
<li>How to use Visual Studio</li>
<li>How to use Github</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I look forward to learn</h3>

<ol>
<li>Get more familiar with html </li>
<li>How to add background images for my website</li>
<li>How to change font size and colors</li>
</ol>

<p>
    I have updated this page to demonstrate what I have learned on the third week of my Web Standards class. This was intitally my second lab file which I 
    have used some css styles to add basic CSS properties. I have learned that CSS is another language used aside HTML which is used to manage how elements 
    are displayd. I have used youtube quite much for this lab. I have also used the w3schools website as well. It was really helpful. I was confused as to why a css 
    file had to be opened however, everything was written on this html life. I only found out how to embed the CSS into the HTML file. On the last lab, I had some
    trouble submitting files into github and running it but this time it has gotten easier. Nevertheless, I will have to practice more on editing fonts, colors, background 
    images, and different styles to get familiar to it.

          In this week's lab, I have used the last lab for further development. This one was easier than the last even though I have had to adjust the layout, font sizes, 
          and other elements to ensure the page is user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices as well as add link anchors. Using media queries was the  most of challenging
          task compared to the others. As all the other labs, youtube is my go to whenever I face any trouble. It feels great when I figure out what I was missing whenever I have 
          trouble running a code.
