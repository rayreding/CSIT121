        <h2>WebP Image File</h2>
        <img src="images/example3.WebP" alt="Antique Vehicle" class="standard-image">
        <p>
            This picture depicts an old, rusted automobile sitting on a small, bumpy road that passes
            through a region of steep mountains. Tiny shrubs and plants border the road, which rises
            to a clear blue sky marked by a slender white aircraft line. Although it seems dilapidated,
            the automobile gives the serene, natural scene personality. The automobile and the lonely,
            silent road evoke memories of bygone travels and adventures.

            The reason I chose this picture is because it represents a journey through life. The old
            automobile indicates perseverance despite deterioration over time, and the rocky and
            twisting route symbolizes the difficulties we encounter. The landscape is a perfect
            illustration of how pictures can express deeper ideas under the surface because it inspires
            feelings of seclusion and meditation.
