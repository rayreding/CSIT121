            This old Mercedes-Benz is parked in a peaceful courtyard with walls that are warm yellow and brown,
            creating a rustic and nostalgic feel. The car's retro appeal is complemented by the building in the
            backdrop with its straightforward, traditional construction. I have chosen this image for the same
            reason I chose the image on the first example, because of how easily these cars have been forgotten
            and only a few number of people are aware of their existence. As a car enthusiast, I would very much
            like to create a big community of car admirers, specially of the 20th century automobiles.
