      <h2>Reflection on Lessons Learned</h2>
       
        Completing this project was both a challenging and rewarding experience.
         Initially, I struggled with the intricacies of HTML and CSS, particularly in ensuring that my 
         pages were not only functional but also visually appealing and accessible. One of the most 
         significant challenges was creating a consistent navigation structure across all four pages
         while adhering to best practices for accessibility. I learned the importance of using semantic
         HTML elements like 
         <ul>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>aside</li>
            <li>footer</li>
          </ul>
         to enhance both the user experience
         and search engine optimization. The process of validating my HTML and CSS without errors was 
         also a meticulous task, but it reinforced my understanding of coding standards and the importance 
         of clean, maintainable code.

      <h2>Insights</h2>
        Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into responsive design by implementing media queries
        for mobile layouts. Testing my site on various browsers and devices revealed some inconsistencies in how 
        styles were rendered, which taught me the importance of cross-browser compatibility. This experience highlighted
        the need for thorough testing to ensure a seamless user experience regardless of the platform. Overall, 
        this course has equipped me with essential skills in web development, emphasizing not just technical proficiency 
        but also the significance of user-centered design principles. I feel more confident in my ability to create 
        functional, aesthetically pleasing websites that adhere to web standards, and I look forward to applying these 
        skills in future projects.
